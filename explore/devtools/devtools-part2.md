# Part 2

1. The bug is the parameters to the funtion print sum is getting passsed as strings instead of type Number. So this means that code would proceed as for example, '1' + '2' = '12' because in js adding strings togehter just glues(cocatenates) them together.
2. To fix this I would type convert both num1 and num2 to convert to type Number so the addidtion can be performed properly.
